9Beat is a basic rhythm game centered around tapping to the beat. This game was written at Hackpoly Hackathon 2018. Pre-mapped songs will play rhythmic patterns you have to match.

# How to Play

  - You will be presented with a 3x3 grid which will have incoming squares.
  - Simple tap the relative key on the numpad when the incoming square matches the edges of the primary square

You can also:
  - Import basic songs based the .osu format
